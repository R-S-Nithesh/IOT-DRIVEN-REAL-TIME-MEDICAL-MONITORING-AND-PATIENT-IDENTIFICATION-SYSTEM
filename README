Internet of Things (IoT) has become a foundational enabler of intelligent, interconnected medical 
infrastructures. By linking sensors, devices, and clinical information systems, IoT facilitates seamless 
acquisition, transmission, and analysis of real-time physiological data. Despite these developments, 
two persistent challenges continue to undermine patient safety and clinical efficiency: the lack of 
continuous patient monitoring and the prevalence of patient misidentification. Conventional 
monitoring approaches rely heavily on periodic manual checks, which fail to capture sudden 
physiological fluctuations, while manual patient verification processes remain vulnerable to human 
error. These limitations can lead to missed clinical cues, delayed interventions, and preventable 
medical complications. 
 
This project introduces an integrated solution using the IoT driven real-time medical monitoring and 
patient identification system. This model combines continuous IoT-based sensing with secure digital 
identification (RFID). The system utilizes a network of wearable and bedside medical sensors such 
as heart rate monitoring, pulse rate, Oxygen saturation, etc., which continuously measures vital 
parameters such as heart rate, body temperature, and blood oxygen saturation. The sensors will be 
communicating wirelessly with a centralized monitoring platform, where data is processed, 
visualized, and analyzed to support timely clinical decision-making. To ensure accuracy and prevent 
data-mixing errors, each patient assigned a unique digital identifier implemented through RFID 
wristbands or machine-readable QR codes allowing all incoming physiological data streams, which 
automatically matches with the correct patient’s electronic health records. This system not only 
strengthens patient identity management, but also enabling uninterrupted observation of critical 
health indicators.
